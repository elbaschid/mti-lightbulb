=============
MTI Lightbulb
=============

Whenever you hear experienced Django developers talk about using Django's
models and define content structures, they tell you that *multi-table
inheritance* (MTI) is bad. Looking at the SQL statements that are generated by
the ORM, you'll see some nasty ``LEFT INNER JOIN`` s in there. The question that
bugged my, however, was **how** bad is it actually, when does it become a real
performance problem and what are the alternatives. 

This project is my opinionated attempt to shed some light and provide a some
alternative suggestions for MTI. This is most likely not a generic solution and
it is not trying to be. The structure I used is driven by the project that
triggered this investigative process: `django-fancypages`_.

I'll provide more details on my approach, the results and how to run the tests
as I get some more time to work on this...be patient and check back soon...
